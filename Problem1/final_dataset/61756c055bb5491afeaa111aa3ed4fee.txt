Usage:
  %s <hostname> [<pptp options>] [[--] <pppd options>]
Or using pppd's pty option: 
  pppd pty "%s <hostname> --nolaunchpppd <pptp options>"
Available pptp options:
  --version        Display version number and exit
  --phone <number>	Pass <number> to remote host as phone number
  --nolaunchpppd	Do not launch pppd, for use as a pppd pty
  --quirks <quirk>	Work around a buggy PPTP implementation
			Currently recognised values are BEZEQ_ISRAEL only
  --debug		Run in foreground (for debugging with gdb)
  --sync		Enable Synchronous HDLC (pppd must use it too)
  --timeout <secs>	Time to wait for reordered packets (0.01 to 10 secs)
  --nobuffer		Disable packet buffering and reordering completely
  --idle-wait		Time to wait before sending echo request
  --max-echo-wait		Time to wait before giving up on lack of reply
  --logstring <name>	Use <name> instead of 'anon' in syslog messages
  --localbind <addr>	Bind to specified IP address instead of wildcard
  --rtmark <n>	Use specified policy routing mark for all packets
  --nohostroute		Do not add host route towards <hostname>
  --loglevel <level>	Sets the debugging level (0=low, 1=default, 2=high)
  --test-type <type>	Damage the packet stream by reordering
  --test-rate <n>		Do the test every n packets
